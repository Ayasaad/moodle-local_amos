Registering a new Moodle branch in AMOS
=======================================

Whenever the new major Moodle version is released, several steps must be done
in AMOS. For the purpose of this document, let us expect that Moodle 2.6 was
just released and the new branch MOODLE_26_STABLE was created in moodle.git.
So now we must tell AMOS that the master branch is 2.7.

1. Make sure that MOODLE_26_STABLE is fetched into the moodle.git clone that
   AMOS tracks.
2. Turn Jenkins off.
3. Switch the portal to the maintenance mode and backup AMOS database.
4. Define new mlang_version for MOODLE_27_STABLE in mlanglib.php.
5. Grep for the current usage of MOODLE_26_STABLE and add the new
   MOODLE_27_STABLE record where needed and/or replace the current reference to
   the 2.6 with the reference to 2.7. Most notably in
   cli/parse-core.php, cli/export-installer.php and cli/fix-drift.php
   Grep for MOODLE_26 and check if other places need an update, too
   (most notably cli/export-zip.php).
6. Make sure that plugins.xml contains declaration for 2.7.
7. Increase the initial version of new language packs in admin/newlanguage.php
8. Deploy the code at the production site.
9. Fork the new branch in the repository

        php cli/make-branch.php --from=MOODLE_26_STABLE --to=MOODLE_27_STABLE

10. Copy moodledata/amos/var/MOODLE_26_STABLE.startat to
    MOODLE_27_STABLE.startat. Fix the content of MOODLE_26_STABLE.startat so
    that it points to the HEAD of the real MOODLE_26_STABLE (and not the master).
11. Make moodledata/amos/var/export-zip/2.7/
12. Force AMOS to regenerate all ZIPs including those for 2.7:

        UPDATE mdl_config_plugins SET value=1 WHERE plugin='local_amos' AND name='lastexportzip';

13. Create new MOODLE_26_STABLE and install_26_STABLE branches at
    /home/amosbot/git/moodle-install and update publish-moodle-install.sh

        su amosbot
        cd /home/amosbot/git/moodle-install
        git checkout -b MOODLE_26_STABLE upstream/MOODLE_26_STABLE
        git checkout -b install_26_STABLE upstream/MOODLE_26_STABLE
        vi ~/bin/publish-moodle-install.sh

14. Create MOODLE_27_STABLE branch at /home/amosbot/git/moodle-langpacks

        cd /home/amosbot/git/moodle-langpacks
        git checkout master
        git branch MOODLE_27_STABLE

    and make a clone for it at /home/amosbot/git/moodle-langpacks-clones

        cd /home/amosbot/git/moodle-langpacks-clones
        git clone /home/amosbot/git/moodle-langpacks 2.7
        cd 2.7
        git checkout -b MOODLE_27_STABLE origin/MOODLE_27_STABLE
        git branch -d master

    and finally modify publish-moodle-langpacks.sh

        vi ~/bin/publish-moodle-langpacks.sh

15. Turn Jenkins on and let it re-generate the ZIP packages.
16. Check http://download.moodle.org/langpack/
17. Clone greylisted strings

        INSERT INTO mdl_amos_greylist (branch, component, stringid)
        SELECT 2700 AS branch, component, stringid FROM mdl_amos_greylist WHERE branch = 2600;

18. Disable the site maintenance mode.
19. Have a beer!
