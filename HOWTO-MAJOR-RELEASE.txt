HOW TO UPDATE AMOS AFTER THE NEW MAJOR VERSION IS RELEASED
==========================================================

1. Add the next branch code to the `branchesall` admin setting.

2. Review the list of supported versions and update the value of
   `branchsupported` there eventually, too.

3. Copy the most recent folder in <moodledata>/amos/export-zip/ to a new one
   named after the newly released version.

4. Run the following in the AMOS database:

```
INSERT INTO mdl_amos_stats (timemodified, branch, lang, component, numofstrings)
SELECT timemodified, YYY AS branch, lang, component, numofstrings FROM mdl_amos_stats WHERE branch = XXX;
```

where XXX is the previous most recent version (such as 403) and YYY is the
newly released version (such as 404).

5. Let Jenkins job rebuild the lang-table.html file and deploy it to the
   download server.
