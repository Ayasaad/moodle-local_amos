Registering a new Moodle branch in AMOS
=======================================

Whenever the new major Moodle version is released, several steps must be done
in AMOS. For the purpose of this document, let us expect that Moodle 2.2 was
just released and the new branch MOODLE_22_STABLE was created in moodle.git.
So now we must tell AMOS that the master branch in 2.3.

1. Make sure that MOODLE_22_STABLE is fetched into the moodle.git clone that
   AMOS tracks.
2. Create moodledata/amos/var/MOODLE_23_STABLE.startat
3. Define new mlang_version for MOODLE_23_STABLE in mlanglib.php
4. Grep for the current usage of MOODLE_22_STABLE and add the new
   MOODLE_23_STABLE record where needed or replace the current reference to
   the 2.2 with the reference to 2.3. Most notably in
   cli/parse-core.php, cli/export-installer.php and cli/fix-drift.php
5. Make sure that plugins.xml contains declaration for 2.3
6. Increase the initial version of new language packs in admin/newlanguage.php

Cloning greylisted strings
--------------------------

INSERT INTO mdl_amos_greylist (branch, component, stringid)
SELECT 2300 AS branch, component, stringid FROM mdl_amos_greylist WHERE branch = 2200;
