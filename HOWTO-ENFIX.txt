HOWTO Prepare branches with en_fix strings for integration
==========================================================

To make it easier for the community to participate on fixing/rewording strings in the English language pack for standard
components (core and standard plugins), the en_fix language pack is created in AMOS. Every two months before the release, strings
accumulated in AMOS are submitted for integration and merged into moodle.git. When they become part of moodle.git, strings are
removed from the en_fix language pack in AMOS. This article describes how to prepare en_fix branches to be submitted for
integration.

1. Create (clone) an issue in the tracker to cover this task.

    <https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=summary ~ "Import fixed English strings (en_fix) into the main English pack" ORDER BY key DESC>

2. At AMOS server, run enfix-export.php and download data generated by it.

    # ssh access-eu
    # get_console lang.moodle.org
    # cd /opt/app/local/amos/cli/
    # sudo -u www-data php enfix-export.php
    # cd /opt/data/amos
    # tar czf /tmp/export-enfix.tgz export-enfix
    # exit

    (use `kubectl get pod|grep lang` to get know the pod id for the following command)

    # kubectl cp -c app lang-moodle-org-123456789-abcde:/tmp/export-enfix.tgz ~/export-enfix.tgz
    # exit

    (now back at your notebook)

    # cd ~/tmp
    # scp access-eu:~/export-enfix.tgz .
    # tar xf export-enfix.tgz

3. Go to your mdk moodle.git checkout and make a branch to be submitted for integration.

    # cd /path/to/moodle/git/clone
    # mdk fix MDL-xxxx enfix

4. Make a temporary directory that will hold symlinks to all language files.

    # mdk run enfix-symlinks.sh

5. Merge the exported strings.

    # mdk run enfix-merge.sh

6. Review the changes.

    # git diff

   Pay attention to eventual [ERR] and [WRN] messages in enfix.log - some
   strings (especially those double-quoted etc) are not detected well.

    # grep -E '\[ERR\]|\[WRN\]' enfix.log

   Check for syntax errors.

    # for f in ./tmp/*.php; do php -l $f; done | grep -v '^No syntax errors detected in'

7. Commit the modified files.

    # git commit -a --author="Helen Foster <helen@moodle.org>" -e -m "MDL-xxxxx lang: Merge English strings from the en_fix language pack"

8. Check against regressions in Behat feature files in the commit.

    # mdk run enfix-check.sh

9. Push.

    # mdk push -t

9. Repeat steps 3-7 for supported STABLE branches as well.
